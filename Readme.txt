## Main Features

* Native & .NET - Miner installer and watchdog coded in C#, Shellcode loader/injector coded in C, miner requires .NET Framework 4.5
* Shellcode - All .NET C# parts are converted into Shellcode and injected using a native C loader, can be disabled
* Injection (Silent/Hidden) - Hide payload behind another process like explorer.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe or other processes
* CPU & GPU Mining - Can mine on Both CPU and GPU (Nvidia & AMD)
* Idle Mining - Can be configured to mine at different usages or not at all while computer is or isn't in use
* Stealth - Pauses the miner and clears the GPU memory while any of the programs in the "Stealth Targets" option are open
* Watchdog - Replaces the miner file if removed and starts it if the injected miner is closed down
* Remote Configuration - Can get the miner settings remotely from a URL every 100 minutes
* Bypass Windows Defender - Adds exclusions into Windows Defender for the general folders the miner uses
* Process Killer - Constantly checks for any programs in the "Kill Targets" and kills them if found

* Improved overall code
* Updated miner
### v1.5.0 (02/10/2021)
**The previous version was supposed to be the last one before the unified miner but I recieved great results by loading everything by Shellcode making it worthwhile to update**

* Added custom tcc C compiler to compile the Shellcode loader
* Added custom windres resource compiler to allow icons, assembly data and run as administrator for the native C program
* Added donut to convert .NET programs into Shellcode
